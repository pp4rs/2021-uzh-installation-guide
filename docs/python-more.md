# Additional Python packages

Anaconda's Python Distribution comes with many of the packages we need to do scientific computing.
If you're interested in all the packages included, click [here](https://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs) and go to the Python 3.9 tab.

However, you may come across packages that are not installed by default.
In this case we recommend you use the `pip` package management tool to install them.
The following recipe works for *all* operating systems.

!!! note
    If your python 3 was accessed via `python3` rather than `python` on the previous page, then type `pip3` instead of `pip` for all of the following python packages.

First let us update pip by typing the following into the terminal

```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
```

If you get an error, try typing instead:

```bash
python -m pip install --upgrade pip --user
```

For this course, we will need the package `Selenium` as part of the web scraping tool kit we will build up. First let us install a dependency for it via

```bash
pip install msgpack
```

We then install `selenium` by entering the following into a terminal:

```bash
pip install selenium
```

`pip` will then go through and install the package we asked for, and any other dependencies.
If this succeeded, the last line it printed out should be:

``` bash
Successfully installed selenium-3.xx.x
```
